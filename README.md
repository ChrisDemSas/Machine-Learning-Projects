# Introduction

Hello there! You have stumbled upon my machine learning project archive, where I upload all of the machine learning projects that I have worked on. There is material ranging from academic projects to mini machine learning exercises to project showcases. Here is a brief rundown:

# Project Showcase
This section is where my most proud machine learning achievements are displayed, where my current knowledge of data science and data engineering is displayed. Here are the projects which I have displayed:

### SEA of News 
A summarization project whereby a web scraper is deplopyed to scrape news from news outlets in Southeast Asia, daily and to summarize the articles. The headlines, date, outlet etc. are collected as data and stored in an sqlite3 database, while the articles are then summarized accordingly. The summarized articles are then generated into a pdf for easy viewing. This entire project is dedicated to geopolitical analysts or anyone who reads the news in order to get a brief overview of the news in other countries. What makes this project stand out is that it is relatively easy to change the script to make it applicable to other countries in the world and its' news outlets, as well as having the goal to make future research more efficient. This project is an ongoing process and is continuously updated.

# Academic Projects
This section is where my academic projects, which include cutting edge deep learning algorithms, are displayed. Here are the projects which I have displayed:

### Pain Detection
People who have dementia often have difficulties in expressing pain through their facial expressions. In this project, myself and two others, compared two cutting edge computer vision deep learning architectures to classify the pain levels in people with dementia. This was done using the PSPI score as a metric to classify pain levels and the use of GPUs to train the model. Finally, a final report was written which achieved a grade of A. This project was written for the class CSC413: Neural Networks and Deep Learning in the University of Toronto.

### Singapore Weather Prediction
An implementation of the paper "Rainfall Monthly Prediction Based on Artificial Neural Network – A Case Study Tenggarong Station, East Kalimantan – Indonesia" by Mislan et. al. The goal of this project is to adapt this algorithm, designed to predict rainfall in Indonesia to the rainfall patterns in Singapore. I changed the optimization from Levenberg-Marquardt to Adam and obtained a lower training loss. However, there are signs of overfitting in the final result.

# Machine Learning Excercises
This section is where my machine learning exercises are displayed, usually using datasets taken from Kaggle. Here are the projects which I have displayed:

### Singapore Energy Usage
Used and compared two regression models, Ridge and Simple linear regression in order to predict and find out the factors which contribute to energy usage in buildings in Singapore. The Ridge model differs from the Simple linear regression model because of the addition of a penalty term, which penalizes high numbers of parameters, keeping the model more simple. The results found that the Ridge Model was preferable because I wanted to keep explanations simple.
